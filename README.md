## Hi there 👋
🔥 GitHub Profile Description (Full English)

Hi, I build things that analyze, automate, and scale.
I'm currently focused on creating smart tools for the crypto market—automation systems, data-driven utilities, and lightweight services that help make faster and more informed decisions.
I'm still new to this field, learning step by step and pushing myself forward.

⚙️ Automation & Workflow Tools – small but powerful utilities that interact with APIs, fetch data, and streamline decision-making

📈 Crypto Analysis Utilities – signal processors, prototype trading bots, backtesting tools, and micro-services

🧩 Data-Oriented Mini Projects – quick experiments, proof-of-concepts, and practical solutions

🛠️ Experiments – new technologies, new ideas, and creative testing

Goal: Build smarter, faster, and more automated systems 🚀

Note: As I grow and reach my goals, I plan to share many of the tools I build completely for free with the community.
